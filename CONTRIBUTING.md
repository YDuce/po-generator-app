# Contributing Guide

This project follows a simple branching and review workflow:

- Create **feature branches** off the `develop` branch for all work.
- Open a **pull request** for each feature branch so it can be reviewed before merging.
- Once approved, pull requests are merged into `main`.
- Use **GitHub Issues** or the project board to track tasks and progress.

Thank you for contributing!
